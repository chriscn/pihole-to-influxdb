# pihole-to-influxdb
Based slightly on my other project, [speedtest-to-influxdb](https://github.com/chriscn/speedtest-to-influxdb). This project leverages the [Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net/) API to gather data about your PiHole instance and store it inside of InfluxDB for your future projects.

This project is automatically built through GitHub actions and the DockerHub file can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/chriscn/pihole-to-influxdb).
